  # Introduction

Welcome to **YourLib Name**, a modular UI component library designed for developers who want a balance between speed and complete source code control.

Our components are built with **React** and **Plain CSS**, ensuring they are lightweight, accessible, and easy to customize.

## Why Choose This Library?

Unlike traditional UI libraries that hide logic inside `node_modules`, we offer two distinct ways to work:

<div className="">

## Install Through NPM

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero Side Effects
Every component is isolated. Importing a `Button` won't bloat your app with styles for a `Table` you aren't using.

### 2. Standard CSS
We use raw `.css` files. No complex CSS-in-JS libraries or pre-processors required. If you know CSS, you can theme this library in seconds.

### 3. Accessible by Default
We follow WAI-ARIA patterns to ensure your application is usable by everyone, right out of the box.

## Project Philosophy

> "The best UI library is the one that disappears into your project."

Most libraries become a burden as your project grows because they are hard to customize. By providing the **Manual Installation** option, we ensure that if you need to change a core behavior, you can just edit the file—no "wrapper" or "hacks" required.
